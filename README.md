Netdata is **distributed, real-time performance and health monitoring** for systems and applications. It is a
highly-optimized monitoring agent you install on all your systems and containers.

Netdata provides **unparalleled insights**, in **real-time**, of everything happening on the systems it's running on
(including web servers, databases, applications), using **highly interactive web dashboards**. 

A highly-efficient database **stores long-term historical metrics for days, weeks, or months**, all at 1-second
granularity. Run this long-term storage autonomously, or integrate Netdata with your existing monitoring toolchains
(Prometheus, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Kafka, Grafana, and more).

Netdata is **fast** and **efficient**, designed to permanently run on all systems (**physical** and **virtual** servers,
**containers**, **IoT** devices), without disrupting their core function.

Netdata is **free, open-source software** and it currently runs on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

Netdata is not hosted by the CNCF but is the 3rd most starred open-source project in the [Cloud Native Computing
Foundation (CNCF) landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/format=card-mode&grouping=no&sort=stars).
